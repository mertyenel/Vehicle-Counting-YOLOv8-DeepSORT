# Vehicle Detection & Counting with YOLOv8 + DeepSORT

This project detects and counts vehicles in a video using **YOLOv8** for object detection and **DeepSORT** for object tracking. It processes real-time video feeds and tracks vehicles as they pass a designated line.

---

## Dataset  
We use the **Vehicle Detection** dataset from Roboflow for training the YOLOv8 model.
